This package primarily involves communication between the ESP32-S3 and the host machine via micro-ROS, including wifi settings, controlling the car by keyboard, PID control of the motor, and reading the odometer.

**You don't need to download the whole package; just downloading the codes in the micro_controller_code file will be enough.**

**Some Basic concepts of ROS2 reference:** https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/tutorials/ready-for-ros/ros-overview
## 1. Software Setup
1. Install ros2 (foxy) on host machine
2. Install Arduino IDE on the host machine, and install ESP32 board. Following this tutorial: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/. Except choose ESPS3 Dev Module board instead in the end. The port number will be ttyxxx in the ubuntu. (Connect ESP32 at USB-UART port) - choose 3.0.5 package in arduino ide
3. Add micro-ros arduino library to Arduino IDE. Download : https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_arduino (choose foxy or the version of ros2 you want to use). Go to Arduino IDE, click Sketch - include library - Add ZIP library, choose the downloaded zip file, click OK. To verify this, go to File - Example - micro_ros_arduino - micro-ros_publisher. Try to compile and upload it to ESP32. (I got an error here saying don't have pre-compile file names ESP32S3. I think this is because we are using ESP32-S3 board instead of a standard ESP32, so I went to the library location, go into src file, and changed the file named ESP32 to ESP32S3. I don't know if it's correct thing to do, but it works for now.)
4. Connect ESP32 with ROS2 - clone micro-ros source and install micro-ros agent. Following this tutorial, but choose the version of ros2 you want: https://www.hackster.io/514301/micro-ros-on-esp32-using-arduino-ide-1360ca. (this tutorial also has add micro-ros arduino library part, but I didn't follow it.)
5. Other reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtVFsgTG3AA (Don't follow him for step4)
6. Wifi connection setup: go to arduino-ide, go to File - Example - micro_ros_arduino - micro-ros_publisher_wifi, and change parameters in set_microros_wifi_transports with your wifi, password and your host machine's ip address. Then run ros2 command: ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent udp4 --port 8888

## 2. Hardware Setup
Build a two-wheel differential drive car with motors with encoders. Main parts include: ESP32-S3 chip, breadboard, L298N motor driver (or other motor driver), two DC motors with encoders, power:

## 3. Code Explanation and How to Run...
It will be helpful to use and test the following codes one by one, since they are built on top of each other.
1. micro-ros_publisher_wifi.ino - This is a demo code for verifying if you have connected the ESP32-S3 with your host machine. Follow the software setup step #6.
2. motor_drive_test.ino - This is just a simple code to drive the car with ESP32-S3 only, without micro-ros.
3. control_car.ino - This code enables you to control the car using keyboard input from your host machine via micro-ROS and wifi. What you need to change are: 1. the motorpin/enablepin number according to your wire connection; 2. set_microros_wifi_transports to your wifi setting.

   After modification, upload this .ino to your ESP32-S3. Then, on your host machine, open the 1st terminal and connect micro-ROS with wifi

   and then open the 2nd terminal, source the workspace, and then run the command: ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
   <img width="822" height="503" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4612ee4d-3943-486a-a955-ec9d9156273b" />

   At this point, if you stay in the 2nd terminal, you should be able to make the car go forward, backward, right, left and stop by using "i", ",", "j", "l" and "k" accordingly.
5. pid_control_new.ino - This code includes the PID control for the speed of the motor. Please also download PidController.h and PidController.cpp in micro_controller_code -> library to your Arduino library to use this piece of code. The step of using this code will be the same as control_car.ino, except that you can adjust the pid parameters kp_m, ki_m, kd_m according to your motor. It will be helpful to print the speed out in the serial monitor and serial plotter while finding the best PID parameters.
6. read_encoder.ino - This is a simple code to test and read the encoders, no micro-ros involved. This code aims to calculate the parameter **mm_pulse** for the next step. **mm_pulse** refers to the distance the car travels while receiving one pulse from the encoder. To calculate this, upload the code to the ESP32-S3, manually rotate the wheel 10 times, and read the encoder value. Get the average number of pulses per full rotation by pulses_per_rotation = encoder_value/full_rotation_times. Then measure the diameter of your wheel, calculate mm_pulse = wheel_diameterâˆ—PI/pulses_per_rotation
7. odem.ino - This is the final code for setting the speed by keyboard (teleopy_twist_keyboard node in ros2), drive the car by the input speed, and read the odometry in the host machine. Please include Kinematics, Motor and PidController files in your Arduino library from micro_controller_code -> library.
   Parameters need to be changed: **set_microros_wifi_transports, kp_m, ki_m, kd_m, mm_pulse, car_wheel_distance**, where car_wheel_distance is the distance between two wheels.

Upload the odem.ino to the ESP32-S3, on your host machine, open 3 terminals, one for the wifi connection, one for controlling the car just like in control_car.ino, and the 3rd one for reading the odom message.

If you saw /odom appears in the ros topic, that means the code is running correctly. Use ros2 topic echo /odom to read the detailed message, you should get something like the following:

That's all for this package! Once we can control the car and read the odometer, we can further do navigation and slam in the future!
